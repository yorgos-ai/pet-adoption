## About the project

The primary aim of this project is to develop an end-to-end machine learning system to predict the likelihood of a pet being adopted from a shelter. A considerable amount of attention is directed towards the implementation of MLOps practices, rather than the development of the machine learning model.

## About the data

Data source: [Predict Pet Adoption Status Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-pet-adoption-status-dataset/data)

The Pet Adoption Dataset provides a comprehensive look into various factors that can influence the likelihood of a pet being adopted from a shelter. This dataset includes detailed information about pets available for adoption, covering various characteristics and attributes.
